# inventory-tracking-app
A simply inventory tracking application, created as my senior development project.

NOTE: Materials will need to be created first for the app to function in it's current state.

Usage:
On the "Materials" page, you will need to add all required materials for any product you would like to track.  To add a material, you will need to name it and assign a starting quantity. 

On the "Products" page, create a product, then add in each required material and it's quantity used to create said product.
